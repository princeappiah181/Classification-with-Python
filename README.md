# Classification with Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where multiple classification algorithms are implemented and evaluated. 

## Objective
The goal of this notebook is to build and evaluate classification models using various algorithms and performance metrics.

## Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are assessed based on the following metrics:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1 Score
- Log Loss (for Logistic Regression)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score

## Dataset
The dataset originates from the **Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology** and contains weather observations from 2008 to 2017. The **weatherAUS.csv** dataset includes variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, with the target variable being **"RainTomorrow"** (indicating whether it will rain the next day).
